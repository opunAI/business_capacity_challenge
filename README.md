# opun_challenge

This exercise is to create is a capacity counter a business might use to keep track of the number of people currently in their store.
<br><br>

The starting project has three screens: 
<br><br>

(1) a welcome screen
<br>
(2) a home screen with the capacity counter and animation
<br>
(3) a settings screen

<br><br>

To complete the project:
<br><br>

(1) Come up with a design for the welcome screen and implement it
<br>

(2) Make the capacity counter animation represent the count of the business by animating the rotation of the number wheels. The first wheel represents the 10's digit and the second wheel represents the 1's digit. 
<br>

(3) Save the app's settings for business name and maximum capacity in firestore
<br>

(4) Set or animate the color on the home screen to red if maximum capacity is reached
<br>

(5) Capacity should not be able to go below zero or above the maximum capacity specified in the settings
<br>

(6) Show business name in the welcome screen and in the home screen if it has been saved
<br><br>

Good to keep in mind:

<br><br>

You can ask questions if you get stuck or want more clarification.
<br>

Feel free to re-factor, add to, or improve on the app any way you see fit. 
<br>

You can use any libraries you can find in pub.dev or anywhere else.

<br>
You have been added to the Opun-Exercise firebase project. In the console's 'Project Overview' page, create a new app and follow the documentation / instructions to connect 
the flutter project to firestore (https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup). Save the business name, maximum capacity, and current count in firestore. Try to stream these values so that the UI is updated in real time if they change.

# Robin's Opun Challenge

## Summary

This was a challenging yet exciting project to work on.  Basically every page was re-designed and built.  This part of the ReadMe will explain all the changes and additions.

## SignIn Page

This page was added to the app because of the task involving Cloud Firestore.  The task was make the save button, on the settings page, functional in that the name of the business would not only<br>
populate on the home page, but would also be saved to Cloud Firestore.  Such a feature did not sound like something that every user could share only.  Therefore it was decided that all data<br>
pertaining to the business should be specific its user.  

## Welcome Page

The task here was to design this page.  The idea behind this business was to put out the message of social distancing.  Therefore the message had to be conveyed through the image that was so clear,<br>
no words were needed .  Pictures of small amounts of people, walking through a building, was considered but then you will wonder, what exactly is the message here?  Then an image of a crowded ares<br>
where everyone is wearing a mask, would definitely bring the idea of, or rather the need for social distancing to mind.  

## Settings Page
